Setup:
Set up a folder (on linux) in .config/ named nvim
Go into folder nvim and clone this repository

Enter nvim using nvim . command.

All online plugins should automatically install (unless outdated)
EXCEPT for a few:
Close nvim and install lua5.1 and rocks and clone local plugins in to a ~/personal directory.
Open nvim with nvim . and run command :lua ColorMyPencils()

Run a healthcheck and all should work.
